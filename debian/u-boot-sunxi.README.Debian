== Installation ==

At this point, you must install U-Boot to flash yourself.

Many sunxi boards (Bananapi, Cubieboard) can be written to SD directly:

 dd if=/usr/lib/u-boot/BOARD/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=1024 seek=8

== U-Boot environment tools ==

fw_printenv / fw_setenv read /etc/fw_env.config for configuration.
