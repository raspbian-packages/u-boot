Amlogic platforms as of u-boot 2022.07 are affected by a bug that
breaks booting using non-EFI boot methods:

  https://bugs.debian.org/1027176

To work around this issue, the current u-boot-amlogic package ships
two variants for each platform, one the default variant which supports
EFI, and a "noefi" variant which has EFI support disabled, allowing
booting with boot scripts such as those generated by flash-kernel, and
syslinux/extlinux style menus such as those generated by u-boot-menu.
